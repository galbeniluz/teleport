The available provisioning modes are:

* `off`: Disables user provisioning.

* `keep`: Enables user provisioning and disables users at session end. The user
  will be stripped of all roles and the user account will be locked.

* `best_effort_drop`: Enables user provisioning and tries to drop user
  at session end. If the drop fails, fallback to disabling them (same as `keep`
  mode).
