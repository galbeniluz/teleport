If you are providing credentials to the plugin with Machine ID, make sure the
value of `identity` is the same as the path of the identity file you configured
`tbot` to generate, `/opt/machine-id`.

Configure the plugin to periodically reload the identity file, ensuring that it
does not attempt to connect to the Teleport Auth Service with expired
credentials.

Add the following to the `teleport` section of the configuration:

```toml
refresh_identity = true
```
