{{ workload="the plugin" }}

Configure `tbot` with an output that will produce the credentials needed by {{
workload }}. As {{ workload }} will be accessing the Teleport API, the correct
output type to use is `identity`.

For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
credentials to a specified directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can
be written to by the Linux user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by
the Linux user that {{ workload }} will run as.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to execute the Terraform
plan later.

You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id`. This contains
the private key and signed certificates needed by {{ workload }} to
authenticate with the Teleport Auth Service.
