  Teleport Access Graph is currently in Preview. Currently, it is only available
  to the Teleport Cloud Team users. Not all Teleport resources are currently
  supported.

Teleport Access Graph is a new way to visualize and understand access to your
infrastructure. It provides a visual representation of the relationships between
users, roles, and resources in your organization.

## The basics

Teleport Access Graph divides your infrastructure into five main components:

1. Users

    ![User Node](../img/access-graph/user-node.png)

    Users are the people who access your infrastructure. They can be employees,
    contractors, or even bots.

2. User Groups

    ![User Group Node](../img/access-graph/user-group-node.png)

    User Groups are collections of users. They can be used to organize users
    based on their role or team.

3. Actions

    ![Action Node](../img/access-graph/allow-action-node.png)

    Actions are the things that users can or cannot do. Actions are related to
    resources. For example, a user can SSH into a node.

4. Resource Groups

    ![Resource Group Node](../img/access-graph/resource-group-node.png)

    Resource Groups are collections of resources. They can be used to organize
    resources based on their role or team.

5. Resources

    ![Resource Node](../img/access-graph/resource-node.png)

    Resources are the things that users can or cannot access. They can be
    servers, databases, or Kubernetes clusters.

## Where to find it

After logging into the Teleport UI, go to Management tab. If enabled, Access Graph options can be find
under the Permission Management section.

## How to use it

Teleport Access Graph can help you to answer questions like:

- Who can access a specific resource?

- What resources can a specific user access?

## How does it work?

Teleport Access Graph imports all Teleport resources and keeps them up to date, so every time you make a change
to your Teleport resources, the Access Graph will reflect those changes.
